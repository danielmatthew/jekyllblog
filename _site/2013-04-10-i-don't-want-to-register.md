Don't make me register to use your app!

> How often do you download an intriguing-sounding app, only to be confronted with a screen full of boxes to fill out before you can even launch it.

Just minutes before, I had downloaded [Snapguide](http://snapguide.com), which looks like an interesting concept.  And after the snazzy 'Getting Started' guide, I was looking forward to exploring the content available… only to be prompted to register. 

NO! 

I don't want to give you my details until I've had a good look around the place. Let me explore, and consume, and when I want to interact: whether it be by creating my own quick guide, or contributing to the comments on another, _then_ ask me for my details, and I'll be more than happy.

While developers often implement the ability to register using an existing Facebook or Twitter login in an attempt to reduce this reluctance - or 'friction' - since I don't use either service I'm frozen out.

It's discussed in [this Boxes and Arrows article](http://boxesandarrows.com/let-them-pee-avoiding-the-sign-upsign-in-mobile-antipattern/) with reference to P&G's SitOrSquat - a ridiculous example of marketing needs over those of their users. Some of the numbers quoted in the comments are really telling: I'd like to see what kind of numbers the Charmin brand managers are seeing for that app. Somehow I don't think they'll be paying the bills.

(PS. Fast Company, I really dislike your mobile site! It's difficult to link to, and the weird scrolling is… well, weird! Why not use the native scrolling inertia by ditching the wrapper and delivering a well-designed mobile experience. [I know some guys who can help!](http://wapple.net))
