---

So forgive some of the perhaps questionable content below - and most likely above. It's tough to write, and I'm just getting down whatever comes into my head: not bothering to scrutinise it to closely, or to think too deeply about the subject matter. 

I'm hoping that words will begin to flow naturally the more I practice setting them in text.
