title: Goodbye Google Reader

[So Google Reader is to be 'retired'](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html)

> We have just announced on the Official Google Blog that we will soon retire Google Reader (the actual date is July 1, 2013). We know Reader has a devoted following who will be very sad to see it go. We're sad too.

> There are two simple reasons for this: usage of Google Reader has declined, and as a company we're pouring all of our energy into fewer products. We think that kind of focus will make for a better user experience.

I've been using the product since 2005, so it'll be kind of sad, but since 2010 it's been only used to power Reeder - first on iPhone, then on Mac. I had only visited the site to occasionally add or delete a feed, but in a recent update, Reeder also made this possible. 

So the question is now: what do I do about my RSS feeds and the money I spent on Reeder? Thankfully, Reeder also supports my Fever installation. I might be thankful for the way Fever aggregates feeds and highlights only the most important items: it may free up a few extra minutes here and there which can go towards completing one of my many unfinished side-projects.
