title: On Jekyll

Installing and getting a site running using Jekyll isn't as difficult as I first thought. The downside comes with publishing: only having a shared host, I can't have Jekyll running on a web-server, which would allow me to quickly add a post and have the changes show immediately. Instead, I have to manually run the Jekyll process and push the compiled folder up to the web server via FTP.
