title: On Shareholders
---
In the UK, are shareholders who have money likely to be less technologically-savvy and more risk-averse? This makes it harder to pivot or change business goals. Education and communication to your shareholders plays a part, but it's often difficult to convince them of the benefits that a new direction would provide. This then leads to the business stagnating because new opportunities are disregarded. 

Can you fire shareholders? 

NB: Probably showing my lack of business acumen here!
